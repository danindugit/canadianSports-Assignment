                <h3>Our Goal:</h3>
                <p>
                    The initiative here at Toronto Sports is to provide potential sports fans with a "starting point"
                    to getting into watching our city's teams. Many find themselves with an interest to start watching
                    hockey, basketball, or even baseball. However, it's hard to fall in love with a team that they barely
                    know anything about. That's why we created Toronto Sports; the place to learn all you need to know
                    about our sports teams to start watching them play with a passion. Our content includes team history,
                    all-time greats, and other fun facts that will spark your interest for the wonderful world of Toronto
