            <p>The Toronto Raptors are a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Raptors are the only Canadian team in the league. Their slogan, "We the North," has been heard around the country. The Toronto Raptors are known for representing the basketball culture in Canada, especially in the GTA. Once you start watching the raptors, it's hard to stop!</p>

            <h3>Team History</h3>
            <p>The Raptors franchise was founded in 1995, 49 years after the NBA was founded. Toronto has made 12 playoff runs, which includes the recent 2019 championship run. For a team that many Americans claim to be the outsider of the NBA, the Toronto Raptors have refused to cooperate.

            <h4>All-time Greats:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li class="vertical-list">Kyle Lowry</li>
                <p>Kyle Lowry is without a doubt, the greatest Raptor of all time. This isn't just because of his stellar numbers, but also because of his impact on the culture of Toronto basketball. Kyle Lowry joined the Raptors in 2012, and has remained loyal to the team ever since. He is a 6-time NBA all-star and was all on the 2016 all-NBA third team. Lowry played a key role in the Raptors' sole championship in 2019.</p>

                <li class="vertical-list">Demar Derozen</li>
                <p>Demar Derozen is an icon for the Toronto Raptors to say the least. Demar played with the Raptors for 9 years before sadly being traded for Kawhi Leonard for the championship run. Demar was the Raptors' MVP for the majority of his time with the Raptors. He is a 4-time all-star, and 2-time all-NBA. Him and Kyle Lowry led the team to some memorable playoff runs.</p>

                <li class="vertical-list">Vince Carter</li>
                <p>Vince Carter is definitely in the top 3 for the greatest raptors of all time. Carter is an olympic gold-medalist, an 8 time NBA all-star, a 2 time all-NBA, and an NBA all-rookie in 1999. Vince Carter was also the slam dunk champion in 2000, where he was seen doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeCUMfraHcA" target="_blank">one of the most impressive dunks in slam dunk competition history</a>. Carter led the Raptors to one of their most impressive playoff runs in their early years, but unfortunately fell short to Allen Iverson and the Philidelphia 76ers in the Eastern-Conference Semi-Finals in 2001.</p>

            <h3>Current Team</h3>
            <p>Currently, the Toronto Raptors are playing with Tampa Bay as their home location due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team still has plenty of championship spirit leftover from their 2019 NBA championship. This season has had its ups and downs due to the pandemic. The raptors started off shaky, but picked themselves back up during the middle of the season. However, the pandemic struck again when their star players, Kyle Lowry, Pascal Siakam, Fred Vanfleet, and OG Anunoby were forced to take temporary leave for COVID-19 protocol. This disrupted the team's flow as they went on severe losing streaks. However, the team is slowly getting back to full strength and are now looking to make a push for their 8th straight playoff appearance, backed by their championship calibre coach, Nick Nurse. Nonetheless, the Raptors are an exciting team to watch, and the 2019 championship is only the beginning.
